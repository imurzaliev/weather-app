# the.weather: Weather App

Search a location for forecast data.

- Display forecast data for a given location.
- Display data in metric or imperial units.
- Unique weather symbols for each forecast description.
- Set background image related to a given location.

Feature ideas to implement.

- Display user location by default.

Bugs to fix.

- Reset time for every search result. (For some reason previously displayed cities time is kept somewhere and keeps flickering between them)
